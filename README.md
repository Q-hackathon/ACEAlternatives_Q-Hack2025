# ACE Alternatives Challenge @ Q-Hack 2025

## Build the Engine that Finds the Next Unicorn

### ðŸ“„ Problem Statement

#### What problem should be solved?

Build an AI-driven platform that autonomously discovers, analyzes, and evaluates startups by crawling publicly available online sources. The platform should extract structured data (e.g., founder background, funding history, tech stack), assess each startupâ€™s potential using ML and NLP techniques (such as LLMs), and present the discovered insights. To kick things off, participants will receive three startup pitch decks and your goal is to determine which one is most worthy of investment using the tools you build.

#### Why is this problem relevant?

Venture capital scouting, due diligence and Know Your Transaction â€˜KYTâ€™ is still largely manual, fragmented, and reliant on networks or luck. With an ever-growing pool of startups and global innovation hubs, fund managers struggle to stay on top of emerging opportunities. Automating this process enables smarter, faster, and more inclusive investment decisions. This challenge sits at the intersection of AI, data engineering, and real-world impact in the startup/VC space.

#### What challenges currently exist?

- Public data is spread across heterogeneous, semi-structured sources (e.g., websites, GitHub, news articles, databases like Crunchbase).
- Startup information is often noisy, duplicated, or inconsistent.
- Public company records to cross check articles of association, shareholders etc.
- Sanction scanners to check if a Politically Exposed Person (PEP) is involved or if the individual has any registered legal cases, outstanding fines etc.
- Valuations of peers to benchmark and check market interest.

### ðŸ“Š DATA & RESOURCES

#### Will datasets or APIs be provided?

Yes. Teams will receive public datasets, sample URLs for crawling, and access to APIs such as Crunchbase or AngelList where applicable. Additional mock or real-time data feeds may also be shared.

#### Is there any specific tech stack or tools that should/can be used?

Participants are free to use any stack, but the following will be available or recommended:
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, Node.js, Docker are recommended, but not mandatory.
- **Cloud & APIs**: OpenAI API, AWS credits (if available).
- **Starter Kits**: Optional boilerplates for crawlers, scoring models, or UI dashboards may be used.

#### Are there any constraints or special conditions to consider?

- Teams should work within the hackathon time window.
- Submission includes: GitHub repo, demo video, README, and presentation.
- Bonus points for stretch goals like founder track record analysis, real-time demo features, or LLM-powered chat interfaces.

### âœ… EXPECTED OUTCOMES

#### Deliverables

- A working prototype or MVP demonstrating the core idea.
- A concise presentation or demo video explaining the solution and its value.
- Source code (GitHub), documentation (with a pitch/presentation), and UI showcase.

#### Feasibility

- Solutions should be technically feasible and demonstrate potential for real-world application.
- Creative interpretations and integration of optional stretch goals are encouraged.
